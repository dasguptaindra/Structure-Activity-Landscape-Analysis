# Activity Landscape Explorer

**A comprehensive Streamlit web application for Structure-Activity Relationship (SAR) analysis using Activity Landscape Modelling. This tool enables chemists and researchers to visualize and analyze molecular similarity-activity relationships, identify activity cliffs, scaffold hops, and other key SAR patterns.**

## 🌟 Features

### Core Analysis
- **Molecular Fingerprinting**: Support for different fingerprint based descriptors (ECFPs, FCFPs, and MACCS keys)
- **Similarity Calculation**: pairwise Tanimoto similarity computation 
- **Activity Landscape Visualization**: Interactive Structure-Activity Similarity (SAS) maps
- **Zone Classification**: Automatic identification of four key SAR regions

### SAR Zones Identified
- **🏔️ Activity Cliffs**: High structural similarity with large activity differences
- **🌊 Smooth SAR**: High structural similarity with small activity differences
- **🏗️ Scaffold Hops**: Low structural similarity with small activity differences  
- **🌫️ Non-descript**: Low structural similarity with large activity differences

### Interactive Features
- **Customizable Thresholds**: Adjustable similarity and activity difference cutoffs
- **Multiple Color Schemes**: Various coloring options (by zone, density, SALI, activity difference)
- **Data Export**: Download full results or zone-specific subsets as CSV
- **Clear Analysis**: Reset and start new analyses with one click
